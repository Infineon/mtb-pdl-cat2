********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_syspm_cb SysPm Callbacks
********************************************************************************
*
* The SysPm driver handles low power callbacks declared in the application.
*
* If there are no callbacks registered, the device executes the power mode
* transition. However, frequently your application firmware must make
* modifications for low power mode. For example, you may need to disable a
* peripheral, or ensure that a message is not being transmitted or received.
*
* To enable this, the SysPm driver implements a callback mechanism. When a lower
* power mode transition is about to take place (either entering or exiting
* \ref group_syspm_power_modes), the registered callbacks for that
* transition are called.
*
* The SysPm driver organizes all the callbacks into a linked list. While
* entering a low power mode, SysPm goes through that linked list from first to
* last, executing the callbacks one after another. While exiting low power mode,
* SysPm goes through that linked list again, but in the opposite direction from
* last to first. This ordering supports prioritization of callbacks relative to
* the transition event.
*
* For example, the picture below shows three callback structures organized into
* a linked list: myDeepSleep1, myDeepSleep2, myDeepSleep3 (represented with the
* \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_t configuration structure). Each structure
* contains, among other fields, the address of the callback function. The code
* snippets below set this up so that myDeepSleep1 is called first when entering
* the low power mode. This also means that myDeepSleep1 will be the last one to
* execute when exiting the low power mode.
*
* The callback structures after registration:
* \image html syspm_register_eq.png
*
* Your application must register each callback, so that SysPm can execute it.
* Upon registration, the linked list is built by the SysPm driver. Notice
* the &myDeepSleep1 address in the myDeepSleep1
* \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structure. This is filled in by the SysPm driver,
* when you register myDeepSleep1. The cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order element
* defines the order of their execution by the SysPm driver.
* Call \ref Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback() to register each callback function.
*
* A callback function is typically associated with a particular driver that
* handles the peripheral. So the callback mechanism enables a peripheral to
* prepare for a low power mode (for instance, shutting down the analog part);
* or to perform tasks while exiting a low power mode (like enabling the analog
* part again).
*
* With the callback mechanism you can prevent switching into a low power mode if
* a peripheral is not ready. For example, driver X is in the process of
* receiving a message. In the callback function implementation simply return
* CY_SYSPM_FAIL in a response to CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY.
*
* If success is returned while executing a callback, the SysPm driver calls the
* next callback and so on to the end of the list. If at some point a callback
* returns CY_SYSPM_FAIL in response to the CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY step, all the
* callbacks that have already executed are executed in reverse order, with the
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL mode parameter. This allows each callback to know that
* entering the low power mode has failed. The callback can then undo whatever it
* did to prepare for low power mode, if required. For example, if the driver X
* callback shut down the analog part, it can re-enable the analog part.
*
* Let's switch to an example explaining the implementation, setup, and
* registration of three callbacks (myDeepSleep1, myDeepSleep2, myDeepSleep2) in
* the application. The \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration are provided
* after the \ref group_syspm_cb_example.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_syspm_cb_example SysPm Callbacks Example
********************************************************************************
*
* The following code snippets demonstrate how use the SysPm callbacks mechanism.
* We will build the prototype for an application that registers
* three callback functions:
*    -# MyDeepSleepFunc1 - Handles CPU Deep Sleep.
*    -# MyDeepSleepFunc2 - Handles CPU Deep Sleep and is associated with peripheral
*       HW1_address.
*    -# MyDeepSleepFunc3 - Handles entering and exiting system Deep Sleep and is
*       associated with peripheral HW2_address.
*
* We set the myDeepSleep1 and myDeepSleep2 callbacks structures to do
* nothing while entering the low power mode (skip on
* CY_SYSPM_SKIP_BEFORE_TRANSITION -
* see \ref group_syspm_cb_function_implementation in
* \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration).
* Skipping the actions while entering low power might be useful if you need
* to save time while switching low power modes. This is because the callback
* function with a skipped mode is not even called avoiding the call and return
* overhead.
*
* Let's first declare the callback functions. Each gets the pointer to the
* \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_params_t structure as the argument.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_Callback_Func_Declaration
*
* Now we setup the \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_params_t structures that we will
* pass to the callback functions. Note that for the MyDeepSleepFunc2 and
* MyDeepSleepFunc3 callbacks we also pass pointers to the peripherals related to
* that callback.
* The configuration considerations related to this structure are described
* in \ref group_syspm_cb_parameters in \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_Callback_Params_Declaration
*
* Now we setup the actual callback configuration structures. Each of these
* contains, among the other fields, the address of the
* \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_params_t we just set up. We will use the callback
* configuration structures later in the code to register the callbacks in the
* SysPm driver. Again, we set things up so that the MyDeepSleepFunc1 and
* MyDeepSleepFunc2 callbacks do nothing while entering the low power mode
* (skip on CY_SYSPM_SKIP_BEFORE_TRANSITION) - see
* \ref group_syspm_cb_function_implementation in
* \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_Callback_Structure_Declaration
*
* Note that in each case the last two fields are NULL. These are fields used by
* the SysPm driver to set up the linked list of callback functions.
*
* The callback structures are now defined and allocated in the user's
* memory space:
* \image html syspm_before_registration.png
*
* Now we implement the callback functions. See
* \ref group_syspm_cb_function_implementation in
* \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration for the instructions on how the
* callback functions should be implemented.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_Callback_Func_Implementation
*
* Finally, we register the callbacks so that the SysPm driver knows about them.
* The order in which the callbacks will be called depends upon the order in
* which the callbacks are registered. If there are no callbacks registered,
* the device just executes the power mode transition, without additional
* interruptions.
*
* Callbacks that reconfigure global resources, such as clock frequencies, should
* be registered last. They then modify global resources as the final step before
* entering the low power mode, and restore those resources first, as the system
* returns from low power mode.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback
*
* We are done configuring three callbacks. Now the SysPm driver will execute the
* callbacks appropriately whenever there is a call to a power mode transition
* function: \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterSleep(), \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterDeepSleep().
*
* Refer to \ref group_syspm_cb_unregistering in
* \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration to learn what to do if you need to
* remove the callback from the linked list. You might want to unregister the
* callback for debug purposes.
*
* Refer to \ref group_syspm_cb_flow in \ref group_syspm_cb_config_consideration
* to learn about how the SysPm processes the callbacks.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_syspm_cb_config_consideration Callback Configuration Considerations
********************************************************************************
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_parameters Callback Function Parameters
********************************************************************************
*
* The **callbackParams** parameter of the callback function is a
* \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_params_t structure. The second parameter
* (**mode**) is for internal use. In the example code we used a
* dummy value CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY to eliminate compilation errors associated
* with the enumeration. The driver sets the **mode** field to the correct
* value when calling the callback functions (the mode is referred to as step in
* the \ref group_syspm_cb_function_implementation). The callback function reads
* the value and executes code based on the mode set by the SysPm driver.
* The **base** and **context** fields are optional and can be NULL.
* Some drivers require a base hardware address and context to store information
* about the mode transition. If your callback routine requires access to the
* driver registers or context, provide those values. Be aware of MISRA warnings
* if these parameters are NULL.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_structures Callback Function Structure
********************************************************************************
*
* For each callback, provide a \ref cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structure. Some
* fields in this structure are maintained by the driver. Use NULL for
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.prevItm and cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.nextItm.
* Driver uses these fields to build a linked list of callback functions.
* The value of cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order element is used to define the order
* how the callbacks are put into linked list, and sequentially, how the
* callbacks are executed. See \ref group_syspm_cb_registering section.
*
* \warning The Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback() function stores a pointer to the
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structure. Do not modify elements of the
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structure after the callback is registered.
* You are responsible for ensuring that the structure remains in scope.
* Typically the structure is declared as a global or static variable, or as a
* local variable in the main() function.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_function_implementation Callback Function Implementation
********************************************************************************
*
* Every callback function should handle four possible steps (referred to as
* "mode") defined in \ref cy_en_syspm_callback_mode_t :
*    * CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY - Check if ready to enter a power mode.
*    * CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION - The actions to be done before entering
*      the low power mode.
*    * CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION - The actions to be done after exiting the
*      low power mode.
*    * CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL - Roll back any actions performed in the callback
*      executed previously with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY.
*
* A callback function can skip steps (see \ref group_syspm_skip_callback_modes).
* In our example myDeepSleep1 and myDeepSleep2 callbacks do nothing while
* entering the low power mode (skip on CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION). If there is
* anything preventing low power mode entry - return CY_SYSPM_FAIL in response to
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY in your callback implementation. Note that the callback
* should return CY_SYSPM_FAIL only in response to CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY. The
* callback function should always return CY_SYSPM_PASS for other modes:
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL, CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION, and CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION
* (see \ref group_syspm_cb_flow).
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_flow Callbacks Execution Flow
********************************************************************************
*
* This section explains what happens during a power transition, when callbacks
* are implemented and set up correctly. The following discussion assumes:
* * All required callback functions are defined and implemented
* * All cy_stc_syspm_callback_t structures are filled with required values
* * All callbacks are successfully registered
*
* User calls \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterSleep() or \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterDeepSleep().
* It calls each callback with the mode set to CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY. This
* triggers execution of the code for that mode inside of each user callback.
*
* The intent of CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY is to only signal if the resources is ready
* to transition. Ideally, no transition changes should be made at this time.
* In some cases a small change may be required. For example a communication
* resource callback may set a flag telling firmware not to start any new
* transition.

* If that process is successful for all callbacks, then
* \ref Cy_SysPm_ExecuteCallback() calls each callback with the mode set to
* CY_SYSPM_BEFORE_TRANSITION. This triggers execution of the code for that mode
* inside each user callback. We then enter the low power mode after all callback
* are executed.
*
* When exiting the low power mode, the SysPm driver executes
* \ref Cy_SysPm_ExecuteCallback() again. This time it calls each callback in
* reverse order, with the mode set to CY_SYSPM_AFTER_TRANSITION. This triggers
* execution of the code for that mode inside each user callback.
*
* A callback can return CY_SYSPM_FAIL only while executing the
* CY_SYSPM_CHECK_READY mode. If that happens, then the remaining callbacks are
* not executed. Any callbacks that have already executed are called again, in
* reverse order, with CY_SYSPM_CHECK_FAIL. This allows the system to return to
* the previous state. If a callback returns a fail then any of the functions
* (\ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterSleep(), \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterDeepSleep())
* that attempt to switch the device into
* a low power mode will also return CY_SYSPM_FAIL.
*
* Callbacks that reconfigure global resources, such as clock frequencies,
* should be registered last. They then modify global resources as the final
* step before entering the low power mode, and restore those resources first,
* as the system returns from low power mode.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_registering Callback Registering
********************************************************************************
*
* While registration the callback is put into the linked list. The
* place where the callback structure is put into the linked list is based on
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order. The callback with the lowest
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order value will be placed at the beginning of linked
* list. The callback with the highest cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order value will
* be placed at the end of the linked list.
* If there is already a callback structure in the linked list with the same
* cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order value as you attend to register, then your
* callback will be placed right after such a callback.
*
* Such a registration order defines how the callbacks are executed:
* * Callbacks with the lower cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order are executed first
* when entering into low power and last when exiting from low power.
* * Callbacks with the higher cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order are executed last
* when entering into low power and first when exiting from low power.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_RegisterCallback
*
* Callbacks with equal cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order values are
* registered in the same order as they are registered:
* \image html syspm_register_eq.png

* Callbacks with a different cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order value will be
* stored based on the cy_stc_syspm_callback_t.order value, with no matter when
* they when registered:
*
* \image html syspm_register_dif.png
*
* This can be useful to ensure that system resources (clock dividers, etc) are
* changed right before entering low power mode and immediately after exiting
* from low power.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsubsection group_syspm_cb_unregistering Callback Unregistering
********************************************************************************
*
* Unregistering the callback might be useful when you need to dynamically manage
* the callbacks.
*
* \snippet syspm_snippet.c snippet_Cy_SysPm_UnregisterCallback
* The callback structures after myDeepSleep2 callback is unregistered:
* \image html syspm_unregistration.png
