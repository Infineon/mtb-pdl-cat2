* \{
* The Cryptolite driver provides a public API to configure the Cryptolite IP block 
* and perform cryptographic and hash operations, as well as generate true random 
* numbers and perform arithmetic/logical operations.
*
* The driver uses a hardware (Cryptolite IP) block to accelerate operations.
*
* The functions and other declarations used in this driver are in cy_cryptolite.h.
*
* The Cryptolite driver supports these standards: AES-128 bit, SHA-256 bits hash,
* TRNG (True Number Generator) and VU (Vector Unit)
********************************************************************************
* \section group_cryptolite_configuration_considerations Configuration considerations
*
* Firmware sets up a cryptographic operation by passing the required data as
* parameters in the function calls.
*
* All Crypto functions require a context and base address. A context is a data
* structure that the driver uses for its operations. Firmware declares a
* context (allocates memory), but does not write or read the values in that
* context. In effect, the context is a scratch-pad you provide to the driver.
* The driver uses the context to store and manipulate the data during
* cryptographic operations. Base is a address of the Cryptolite IP registers.
*
* Crypto functions are not thread-safe. Applications must use its own locking
* mechanism to ensure that functions in this driver are called by only one
* thread at a time.
*
* Cryptolite TRNG functions can execute in parallel with AES, SHA, and VU.
* functions.

*     <td>Block cipher</td>
*     <td>An encryption function for fixed-size blocks of data.
*     This function takes a fixed-size key and a block of plain text data from
*     the message and encrypts it to generate the cipher text. Block ciphers are
*     reversible. The function performed on a block of encrypted data will
*     decrypt that data.</td>

*     <td>Block Cipher mode</td>
*     <td>A mode of encrypting a message using block ciphers for messages of an
*     arbitrary length. The message is padded so that its length is an integer
*     multiple of the block size. Electronic code book (ECB), cipher block
*     chaining (CBC), and cipher feedback (CFB) are modes of using block ciphers
*     to create an encrypted message of an arbitrary length.

*     <td>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</td>
*     <td>The [AES standard] (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf)
*     specifies the Rijndael algorithm, a symmetric block
*     cipher that can process 128-bit data blocks using cipher keys with
*     128-, 192-, and 256-bit lengths. Rijndael was designed to handle
*     additional block sizes and key lengths. However, they are not adopted in
*     this standard. AES is also used for message authentication.
*     </td>
*   </tr>
*
*   <tr>
*     <td>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)</td>
*     <td>A cryptographic hash function.
*     This function takes a message of an arbitrary length and reduces it to a
*     fixed-length residue or message digest after performing a series of
*     mathematically defined operations that practically guarantee that any
*     change in the message will change the hash value. It is used for message
*     authentication by transmitting a message with a hash value appended to it
*     and recalculating the message hash value using the same algorithm at the
*     recipient's end. If the hashes differ, it indicates that the message is corrupted.
*     For more information see [Secure Hash standard description]
*     (https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/2/archive/2002-08-01/documents/fips180-2.pdf).
