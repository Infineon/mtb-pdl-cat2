# mtb-pdl-cat2 peripheral driver library

## Overview

The PDL simplifies software development for PSoC&trade; 4 and PMG1 (CAT2)
family of devices. The PDL integrates device header files, startup code, and
peripheral drivers into a single package. The drivers abstract the hardware
functions into a set of easy-to-use APIs. These are fully documented in the
[PDL API reference manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat2/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html).

## Features

- Includes all the updates made to the peripheral drivers for ModusToolbox&trade;
  software

- Contains standard set of PSoC&trade; 4/EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 digital and analog peripheral
  drivers that enable rapid peripheral software development in third-party IDEs

- The Arm&reg; Cortex® microcontroller software interface standard (CMSIS) core
  access header files

- CMSIS-compliant device header files, startup code (platform initialization),
  and device configuration header files

The PDL reduces the need to understand register usage and bit structures,
thus easing software development for the extensive set of peripherals in the
PSoC&trade; 4 and PMG1 series. See the
[PDL API reference manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat2/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)
for detailed information.

The PDL requires [core library](https://github.com/Infineon/core-lib) v1.1.4 or later.

See the [PDL release notes](./RELEASE.md) for release-specific information.

## Peripheral drivers

The PDL provides a high-level API to configure, initialize, and use a peripheral
driver. The drivers are designed for peripheral IP blocks.
See [PDL API reference manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat2/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)
for the list of drivers.

## Quick start

See the "Getting started" section of the [PDL API reference manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat2/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/page_getting_started.html).
